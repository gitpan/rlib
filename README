NAME
    rlib - add library directories relative to script location

SYNOPSIS
     use rlib;
     use MyModule;

DESCRIPTION
    The *rlib* pragma module makes it easy for scripts to pick up library
    modules relative to where the scripts themselves are installed. The
    *rlib* pragma tries to add the SCRIPTDIR/lib and SCRIPTDIR/../lib to
    @INC. If none of these directories exists you will get a warning if you
    are running perl with the `-w' option.

    Basically it does the same as:

       use FindBin;
       use lib "$FindBin::Bin/lib";
       use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";

SEE ALSO
    the FindBin manpage, the lib manpage, the blib manpage
