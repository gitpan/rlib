rlib allows @INC to be modified with relative path names. Where the
pathname is relative from depends on where the module is used from.

If used from the package main, it is assumed that it is being called from
a script and so all paths will be treadted relative to where the script
was found, this is done by using FindBin.

If not called from the package main, but from a different package,
then all paths are treated as relative to the root of the lib
directory structure where the file was loaded from.

To use this module you will need to first install the File::Spec
module, which is avaliable on CPAN from
